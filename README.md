### Paired Project

## Overview

Not sure what movie to watch tonight? Want to find out if it's any good? You need to visit Rancid Tomatillos!

The Rancid Tomatillos Web App, built in React, displays some of the newest films out there! Rancid Tomatillos features an easy to use interface that shows the movie rating on any movie poster. Once hovering over a movie poster the movie title and release year are available as well. If you then click a movie poster a movie synopsis/overview is available about the film along with additional movie details like genre and even a Trailer of the film!

## React

- This multi page App with React was an exercise for us to learn and grow our knowledge of the framework.
- React Router was implemented to give unique URLs to the movies as well as default URL handling. Rancid Tomatillos shed light on how a multi page app might work with unique URLS in the real-world.
- Compared to previous projects in VanillaJS, React maintained a sync'd state at all times, which expedited the process of displaying information accurately.

## Cypress

- All Testing of User views and user interactions
- Error Handling of Server errors and invalid URLS Tested
- Fetch requests are stubbed
