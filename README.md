### Paired Project

## Overview

Have you ever found yourself wondering what to make for dinner? This simple application displays a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes and plan shopping trips around them. Users can view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook. Our application, "Fork to Table" is a collaborative version of What's Cookin.

## Accessibility

Our group is proud to have a LightHouse score of 100% and to have gained a new perspective after learning about WAI ARIA recently. We hope to continue to make our future applications accessible to all through the code we build.

## Local Set-Up Instructions

- From the repo click the code button and copy the SSH link.
- Open terminal by pressing command + space bar, and search for terminal
- Inside of you terminal type `git clone` and then paste the ssh link. It should look like this: [git@github.com:userigorgithub/whats-cookin.git](git@github.com:userigorgithub/whats-cookin.git)
- In your terminal type `cd whats-cookin`
- Run `NPM install` from your command line: npm install
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force`
- Then type `npm start`
- This will run the Webpack in the terminal so you can view and use the application in your browser
- The browser should then deploy using a local host
- Find the line that says Project is running at: http://localhost:8080/ Copy and paste that URL into your browser into your browser. Now the application set up and ready to use!

- NOTE: Make sure that you type `Control + C` in your terminal when you are done using the application. This ensure the server will stop running before your close your Terminal.

## Instructions for Use

- On opening the browser, a user may roam the application as they choose.
- A user can view a list of all recipes, click on a recipe to view more information including directions, ingredients needed, and total cost.
- A user can filter recipes by a tag or search recipes by their name.
- A user can view what ingredients exist inside of their pantry and check their list of recipes to cook and see if their pantry has enough ingredients to cook a meal.
- A user can add more ingredients to their pantry on their pantry page.

## Technologies Used

- ES6 JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Webpack
- Fetch API
- Mocha
- Chai
- GET and POST requests

## Future Features

- Instead of displaying a random user when the app starts, implement a login, or a way to select which user to view
- Implement SCSS and Sass to create a dynamic style on page

## Project management

- We used a [Github Project Board](https://github.com/userigorgithub/whats-cookin/projects/1) stay on task and meet the deadline.
- The project specs and guideline for Part One of this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/whats-cookin-part-one.html)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
